# Notes
These DLL-files for the Esri File Geodatabase Api were downloaded from [here](https://github.com/Esri/file-geodatabase-api).  
So if you want to update that, you have to download them from there and replace the files here.  
If the names change, remember to also update the references inside of the csproj.
